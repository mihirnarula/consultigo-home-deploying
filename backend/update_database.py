# Porter's Five Forces Framework

Porter's Five Forces is a framework for analyzing a company's competitive environment. The five forces are:

1. **Threat of new entrants:** How easy is it for new competitors to enter the market?
2. **Bargaining power of suppliers:** How much control do suppliers have over prices?
3. **Bargaining power of buyers:** How much control do customers have over prices?
4. **Threat of substitute products:** How easily can customers find alternatives?
5. **Competitive rivalry:** How intense is the competition among existing companies?

## How to Apply:
1. Start by defining the industry and scope of analysis
2. Analyze each force systematically
3. Consider how each force impacts profitability
4. Develop recommendations based on your analysis

## Example Application:
For a market entry case, assess whether the target market has high entry barriers (good for incumbents) or low barriers (good for new entrants). Evaluate supplier concentration, buyer sensitivity to price, availability of substitutes, and competitive intensity to determine overall market attractiveness.

# Profitability Analysis for Restaurant Chain

## Profit Tree Analysis
Since revenue has remained stable, I'll focus on cost factors:

### Fixed Costs:
- **Rent**: Have any locations been renegotiated or moved to higher-cost areas?
- **Labor**: Have minimum wage increases affected staffing costs?
- **Equipment**: Has there been investment in new equipment/technology?

### Variable Costs:
- **Food Costs**: Have ingredient prices increased?
- **Energy**: Have utility costs risen?
- **Packaging**: Have takeout/delivery packaging costs increased?

## Key Findings
After analysis, the following issues were identified:
1. **Food Cost Inflation**: 15% increase in key ingredients (meat, dairy) without menu price adjustments
2. **Labor Costs**: 10% increase due to minimum wage increases and higher turnover requiring training costs
3. **Delivery Costs**: 8% increase in delivery-related expenses as more customers order online

## Recommendations
1. **Menu Engineering**: Redesign menu to highlight high-margin items, adjust prices selectively
2. **Supplier Negotiation**: Seek volume discounts or alternative suppliers for key ingredients
3. **Labor Optimization**: Implement scheduling software to optimize staffing levels based on demand
4. **Delivery Strategy**: Renegotiate terms with delivery platforms or develop in-house delivery solution
5. **Energy Efficiency**: Invest in energy-efficient equipment to reduce utility costs

## Expected Impact
Implementing these recommendations could improve profit margins by 4-6% within 6 months.
