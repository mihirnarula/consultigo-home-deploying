## Database Models

### User
- User account information (username, email, password hash)
- Profile details (first/last name, bio, profile picture)
- Authentication status (is_active, is_admin)

### Problem
- Problem details (title, description, category)
- Metadata (difficulty level, estimated completion time)
- Relationships to examples, frameworks, and submissions

### ProblemExample
- Example case solutions for reference
- Associated with specific problems

### Framework
- Consulting frameworks and methodologies
- Structured content for learning reference

### Submission
- User solutions to problems
- Processing status tracking
- Connection to feedback

### AIFeedback
- AI-generated evaluation of submissions
- Detailed scoring across multiple dimensions:
  - Overall solution quality
  - Structure and organization
  - Assumptions quality/clarity
  - Analysis quality/math accuracy
  - Communication effectiveness

## Installation and Setup

### Frontend
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/consultigo-home.git
   cd consultigo-home
   ```

2. Open the frontend in your browser:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   # Use any local development server or simply open index.html in a browser
   ```

3. For development with live reload, you can use any simple HTTP server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python's built-in HTTP server
   python -m http.server
   
   # Or with Node.js's http-server
   npx http-server
   ```

### Backend
1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   python run_setup.py
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

5. The API will be available at http://localhost:8000

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /token`: Obtain a JWT token with email/password
- `GET /users/me`: Get current user information

### Users
- `POST /users/`: Create a new user account
- `GET /users/{user_id}`: Retrieve user information
- `PUT /users/{user_id}`: Update user information

### Problems
- `GET /problems/`: List all problems
- `GET /problems/{problem_id}`: Get a specific problem
- `POST /problems/`: Create a new problem (admin only)
- `GET /problems/{problem_id}/examples`: Get examples for a problem

## User Flow

1. **Authentication**: User signs up or logs in to access the platform
2. **Dashboard**: From the home page, user selects a practice module (Case Studies, Guesstimates, Frameworks, or Examples)
3. **Selection**: User browses available problems/content and selects an item
4. **Practice**: For case studies and guesstimates:
   - User reads the problem statement
   - User develops and types their solution
   - Solution is automatically saved as they type
5. **Feedback**: User submits their solution for AI evaluation
   - System processes submission using Google Gemini AI
   - User receives detailed feedback with scores and improvement suggestions
6. **Learning**: For frameworks and examples:
   - User studies the provided content
   - User can reference this material when working on case studies and guesstimates
7. **Progress Tracking**: User can view their submission history and performance statistics in their profile

## AI Integration

### Google Gemini 2.0 Flash
- **Implementation**: API integration with the Gemini generative AI model
- **Purpose**: Evaluate user solutions and provide expert-quality feedback
- **Prompting Strategy**: Structured prompts that guide the AI to analyze:
  - Solution structure and organization
  - Quality of assumptions
  - Analytical depth and accuracy
  - Communication clarity and effectiveness
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Local mock feedback generation when API calls fail

### Feedback Format
- **Overall Score**: Numerical evaluation (1-10) of solution quality
- **Dimension Scores**: Detailed scoring across specific skill areas

## Deployment Considerations

The current implementation is designed for local development. For production deployment, consider:

1. **Database**: Migrate to a production database (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
2. **Authentication**: Implement more robust security measures
3. **Frontend Hosting**: Deploy static assets to a CDN
4. **Backend Hosting**: Use a production-grade ASGI server (Uvicorn, Hypercorn)
5. **Environment Variables**: Secure storage of API keys and credentials
6. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and performance monitoring
7. **HTTPS**: Enable secure connections
8. **Rate Limiting**: Protect API endpoints from abuse
